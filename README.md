# National Parks Quiz

## Description
A quiz with 8 questions about the US National Park System. Featuring a timer, and a scoring function. 

## History
I followed a tutorial for this activity, which was actually really great for seeing how a whole page comes together--creating the major elements, then creating the associated CSS styling, then creating the JavaScript operators to make it work. 

## On the other hand, the tutorial included some CSS code I didn't really want, and I didn't want to "shuffle" the questions, but I couldn't make it work without including that language. And now I'll need to incorporate the timer and scoring functions without breaking what I have already.

## I did have some Git issues again, but thanks to Scott I was able to fix them, and understand a little more about the process. 

## Usage
Answer the questions, learn something maybe. 

## Roadmap
Still to do:
- Add onclick functions to proceed to next question. 
- Add onclick functions to record high scores.
- Add a timer. I researched this but had trouble with git, and matching up the functions, I just ran out of time.
- Create the counter/highscores function
- Want to remove question shuffling
- Have bonus info I'd like to figure out how to display at the bottom of the quiz.
- Also would like to add a background of Half Dome but there's really no time for that.
